				<div>
					When I was 12 years old, I discovered my now passion and new found love for technology in computer class. I was interested in how it worked and everything about it. 
					Ever since then, I've been following this passion to work in the field: I've gone to summer camp where they taught us how to make videogames; Most of my high-school 
					classes allowed me to learn calculus, circuits, robotics and more importantly: programming. <br><br>
					I also always wanted to study abroad to challenge myself, after searching I was accepted at UPPA in France, where I'm currently studying what I love and perfecting 
					my french.
